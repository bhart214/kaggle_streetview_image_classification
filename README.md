Kaggle Competition: Classification of Google Streetview Images

This project is from the Kaggle "Getting Started With Julia" competation.  However, we decided to implement our ideas with R.  The goal is to correctly classify a set of test images based on a set of given training images.  All of the images were taken from Google Streetview and consist of capital and lower case letters and numeric digits 0-9 for a total of 62 classes.
